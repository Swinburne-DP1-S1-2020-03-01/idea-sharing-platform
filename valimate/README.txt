all the files in here you do not need to touch, the validation should work by itself

If it does not then read this website for a guide to use: https://medium.com/@jamesseanwright/automatically-validate-html-with-node-js-and-valimate-196c71a349bf

To configure, open the file "valimate.json" to configure the paths used
The paths need to be configured to the local host (see my configuration as example)
